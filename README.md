# Lending club case study
> We are a Consumer Finance Company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
We must decide for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
